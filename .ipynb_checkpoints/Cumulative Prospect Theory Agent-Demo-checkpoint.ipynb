    "Kahneman & Tverski modified their original account of Prospect Theory with Cumulative Prospect Theory (1990). The CPTAgent exhibits the same choice behavior shown by the PTAgent for each of the problems considered above. Additionally, the cumulative features of the weighting function better demonstrates the choice patterns of respondents when considering probabilistic insurance, namely, the preference against probabilistic insurance seems to hold under a broader range of probabilities $r$.
